I do not have any expeirence in the field of computer programming or any of the computer language. I think it is not that easy to learn C language as it seemed to me earlier but I will try to give my best to learn the things that my professor will teach.

The process of firstly writing the code and then compiling it with the help a compiler is quiet difficult for me personally. i find it little hard maybe, because i don't have any experience in this. Hopefully I'll find it easy in coming days.

I want to be a sucssessful programmer and get a good job in this field. And this is the perfect course according to me to achieve my goals and get my career started.
